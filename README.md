# Android SDK for Built.io Contentstack

Android client for [Built.io Contentstack](https://www.built.io/products/contentstack/overview)  - the API-first CMS for your app. This SDK interacts only with the [Content Delivery Rest API](https://contentstackdocs.built.io/developer/restapi).

Contentstack is the CMS without the BS. With this headless cms, developers can build powerful cross-platform applications using their favorite front-end javascript frameworks and Android/iOS clients. 

You build your front-end and we will take care of delivering content through APIs, optimized for each destination. - [more here](https://www.built.io/products/contentstack/overview) 

### Prerequisite
 - Android studio or Ecilipse 

### Setup and Installation
To use this SDK on android platform, you will have to install the SDK according to the steps given below.

- Download the Contentstack android sdk.

- The zip file contains the Built.io Contentstack SDK. Extract the Contentstack zip file at the desired location.

- #####Android Studio
	- Copy Contentstack-x.x.x.jar to your project's libs folder.

	- Add dependency code in your build.gradle file.
	
			compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])


- #####Eclipse
	- Copy Contentstack-x.x.x-javadoc, Contentstack-x.x.x.jar, Contentstack-x.x.x.jar.properties to your project's libs folder.

	- Add jar refrences in the projects propeties --> Java Build Path --> Libraries tab.
			
- Configure android manifest with permissions.
 
			<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
 			<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

To start using the SDK in your application, you will need to initialize the stack by providing the required keys and values associated with them.

		Stack stack = Contentstack.stack(context, API_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN, ENVIRONMENT);


### Key Concepts for using Contentstack

##### Stack
A stack is like a container that holds the content of your app. Learn more about creating stacks. [watch videos tutorials with documentation](https://contentstackdocs.built.io/developer/android/quickstart)

##### Content Type

A content type is the structure of a section with one or more fields within it. It is a form-like page that gives Content Managers an interface to input and upload content. 

##### Entry

An entry is the actual piece of content created using one of the defined content types. 

##### Asset

Assets refer to all the media files (images, videos, PDFs, audio files, and so on) uploaded to Built.io Contentstack. These files can be used in multiple entries.  

##### Environment

A publishing environment corresponds to one or more deployment servers or a content delivery destination where the entries need to be published. 


### 5 minute Quickstart

#### Initializing your Stack client
To initialize a Stack client, you need to provide the required keys and values associated with them:

	Stack stack = Contentstack.stack(context, API_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN, ENVIRONMENT);

To get the api credentials mentioned above, you need to log into your Contentstack account and then in your top panel navigation, go to Settings -> Stack to view both your `API Key` and your `Access Token`


The `stack` object that is returned a Built.io Contentstack client object, which can be used to initialize different modules and make queries against our [Content Delivery API](https://contentstackdocs.built.io/rest/api/content-delivery-api/). The initialization process for each module is explained below.


#### Querying content from your stack

Let us take an example where we try to obtain all entries of the Content Type my_content_type.

	Query query = stack.contentType(CONTENT_TYPE_UID).query();  
	
Let us take another example where we try to obtain only a specific entry from the Content Type `my_content_type`.

	Entry entry = stack.contentType(my_content_type).entry(ENTRY_UID);


### More Usage

You can query for content types, entries, assets and more using our completely documented api. Here are some useful examples:

Get a specific `ContentType` by `content_type_uid`

	ContentType blogType = stack.contentType("blog");;

Get a specific `Entry` by `entry_uid`

	Entry blogEntry = stack.contentType("blog").entry("blt1234567890abcef");

Fetch all entries of requested `content_type` by quering.

	Query query = stack.contentType("blog").query();		
### Compile and Create

Run gradle `command` in terminal to create .jar.

	./gradlew clean createJar

Outputs can be found in app/build/libs/
